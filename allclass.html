<div class="dakhil">
    <h1> DAkhil Section</h1>
    <p> Every year students from different place are admitted to our madrasa.
        Our student population at the entry level is approximatly 150.
        Dakhil Madrasa (Arabic: مدرسة الداخل‎) 
        is a level of Madrasa where education is 
        provided from class one to class ten and 
        at the end of class ten a Dakhil pass 
        certificate is awarded through a public 
        examination which is equivalent to the
         Secondary School Certificate (S.S.C.). 
         This education
         system was originally started with the aim
          of providing religious education to Muslim
           children along with general education. That is, it has been created by combining general education (school-college) and religious education (Qawmi Madrasa) parts into an education system/syllabus. And Dakhil Madrasas are run by
         the government and financed by the government.<br/><br/>

         Curriculum

Edit

Dakhil Madrasahs provide education at various levels and in various departments. For example:

Dakhil 6th-8th

Dakhil General

Dakhil Mujabbid

Dakhil Science

Dakhil Hifzul Quran

Dakhil Business Studies

Recently, a decision has been taken to
 grant permission to teach the subject of 
 'Information and Communication Technology' 
 in Dakhil Madrasahs. 

Examination System:
The procedure for the Dakhil examination is
 the same as that of the SSC examination. 
 Each subject has a 3-hour examination,
  the full value of which is 100 marks.
   The examination contains both 'multiple choice'
    and 'creative' types of questions.
     There is no break between the 'multiple 
     choice' and 'creative' tests. If the total 
     value of the 'multiple choice' questions 
     is 30 marks, the allotted time is 30 minutes.
     On the other hand, if the total value of the 
     'multiple choice' questions 
    is 25 marks, the time allotted is 30 minutes.<br/><br/>

    
To run a Dakhil Madrasa, official recognition
 from the Bangladesh Madrasa Education Board
  is required. The Madrasa Education Act of 
  1978 established this board to regulate the
   Madrasa education system in Bangladesh.
    Entrance examinations are conducted by
     this board and admission letters are
      issued by the board based on the results 
      of the students. Departments such as science, 
      commerce, etc. can be opened with the
       permission of this council. Officials
        of the board regularly visit Dakhil Madrasas 
        and evaluate the educational activities.
         Private madrasas are required to register
          with the government 
MPO on the recommendation of the board.
